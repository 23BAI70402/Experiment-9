We created a base class Person in JavaScript with common properties: name and age.

The Person class also has a method displayInfo() to show the basic details.

We then created two subclasses using inheritance:

Student → extends Person and adds a new property course.

Teacher → extends Person and adds a new property subject.

Both Student and Teacher classes override the displayInfo() method to include their own extra details along with the base class information.

In the React component, we created instances of Student and Teacher.

Finally, we displayed their details on the web page, showing how inheritance and method overriding work in ES6 classes.
